                        Where is Your Personal Data Processed and Stored?</h5>
                    6.1
                    Pavaga Gaming always tries to process Your Personal Data within the EU/EEA. However, in some
                    situations Your
                    Personal Data may be transferred to and processed in a country outside the EU/EEA. In those
                    cases, Pavaga Gaming
                    ensures that appropriate measures are in place to protect Your Personal Data in accordance with
                    applicable
                    data protection law.

                    <h5>7.
                        Cookies</h5>
                    7.1
                    A “cookie” is a small text file sent from Pavaga Gaming's server to Your browser. The cookie cannot
                    identify You
                    personally, it can, only recognize the browser that is installed on Your computer which is used
                    to access
                    this Site. Different cookies are sent to different computers if You access this Site from
                    different
                    computers. Cookies are required for the system to function correctly and safely, for example
                    when You login
                    to Your User Account. Cookies are also used to measure the data traffic to the system and for
                    statistical
                    reasons.

                    There are two types of cookies: one type is called “session cookies”, and the other is called
                    “permanent
                    cookies”. Pavaga Gaming's system uses both session cookies and permanent cookies.

                    A session cookie is sent between Your computer and Pavaga Gaming's server in order for the system to
                    work
                    properly during Your visit on this Site. A session cookie disappears when the browser is closed
                    and is thus
                    not stored on the computer.

                    A permanent cookie is stored in Your computer and allows Pavaga Gaming's systems to recognize Your
                    computer's IP
                    address and web browser the next time You login.

                    You can decline Pavaga Gaming's system to store cookies on Your computer by editing a setting in
                    Your browser.
                    Such settings may imply that certain functions on this Site will not function properly or be
                    available.

                        Deselection of Personal Data</h5>
                    8.1
                    Your Personal Data will be stored as long as You have an active User Account. Eleven months
                    after Your last
                    login will receive a reminder on Your inactivity. Upon further inactivity, Your User Account
                    will be
                    blocked. Two years after Your last login, Your User Account will be deleted due to inactivity
                    unless the
                    data is required for a specific reason or Pavaga Gaming has agreed with You to store the Personal
                    Data for a
                    specified period. Pavaga Gaming reserves the right to delete Personal Data earlier if Pavaga Gaming
